# .NET client library for Encryptonize-as-a-Service

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- The [Encryptonize Core](https://github.com/cyber-crypt-com/encryptonize-core) service must be deployed and accessible. **TODO**: Link to information on how to deploy?

### Installation

**TODO**: How do we want to install it? Through nuget.org, private repository, shipping DLLs, or something else?

### How to use

#### Configuring the client

Creating a new client is easy, it only requires you to pass the URL of the Encryptonize service, the username and the password into the constructor:

```csharp
using Encryptonize.Client;

var client = new EncryptonizeClient(encryptonizeUrl, encryptonizeUsername, encryptonizePassword);
```

Afterwards the client is ready to be used, and the different methods can be called. See the [API reference](#api-reference) for a description of all the available methods.

**TODO**: Insert link to API reference.

## Development

### Build
Required directory structure:
```
.
├── encryptonize-core
└── encryptonize-premium/
    └── clients/
        └── encryption-service/
            └── dotnet/
                └── Encryptonize.Client/
                    ├── src
                    └── tests/
                        └── Encryptonize.Client.Tests
```
Build the library:
```
dotnet build src/Encryptonize.Client.csproj
```

### Run tests
The tests require having the Encryptonize Service running. You can configure the connection to the service through environment variables:
```
E2E_TEST_URL  = <Encryptonize Service endpoint>
E2E_TEST_CERT = <Client certificate>
E2E_TEST_UID  = <Encryptonize User ID>
E2E_TEST_PASS = <Encryptonize User Password>
```

To run the tests:
```
dotnet test tests/Encryptonize.Client.Tests/Encryptonize.Client.Tests.csproj
```

To build and run a Dockerized instance of the Encryptonize Service and run the tests against it you can use the make target from [`encryptonize-premium`](https://github.com/cyber-crypt-com/encryptonize-premium/blob/master/encryption-service/makefile):
```
make dotnet-tests
```

## Limitations

- Currently the library does not support any of the premium features
